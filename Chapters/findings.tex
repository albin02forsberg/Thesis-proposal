\section{Expected Findings}
The software used in \cite{bigData} was Hadoop, which is an open source framework that uses an HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to store large amounts of data. To process and analyze data, a programming module called MapReduce is used.  The project will not use Hadoop, but the findings were made through it.   

Firstly, according to the \cite{bigData}, companies that adopted Data-Driven Decision Making became more productive and profitable than their competitors.  To be precise, those who used this approach saw on average, an increase of 5\% in productivity and 6\% profitable.  

Secondly, the source states that Passur Airlines analyzed big data to predict the arrival times of the planes so that they could improve their decision making instead of solely relying on intuition or experience.  The main reason why they changed their approach is to prevent any sort of delay, for example, if the plane has arrived before the staff is ready then the passengers will be trapped.

Lastly, \cite{bigData} describes how in Italy they used the analyses to help retired people with healthcare and other emergency services. A system with the information from the customer was created by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation), with the sole goal of helping the people in Italy. The system is installed and used in the home of the people to monitor the water, elec-tricity, O2 levels, and clamminess. If the monitors found any abnormal patterns or measure-ments, depending on the situation a police officer, fireman or paramedics would be contacted. \cite{bigData} also states that, through the system, they managed to save up to 30\% in assistance costs and it also delivers help in a shorter time.

\section{Company Collaboration}
The bachelor thesis will work together with the hospital \textit{Länssjukhuset Ryhov} to help them analyze data. The hospital has provided us with medical data stretching from 2012 to 2020, the data contains data on different types of addictions. According to the ~\cite{medData}, Sweden has two major concerns when it comes to substances: high mortality rates caused by the use of drugs, and the use of tramadol and pregabalin as potential ”gateway drugs”. Therefore, we will work together with the hospital to provide a thorough analysis and potential adjustments that can be implemented to help improve the health issues that Sweden is facing.

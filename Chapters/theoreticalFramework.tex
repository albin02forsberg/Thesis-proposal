\section{Theoretical Framework}

The theoretical framework will mostly be based on 
\textit{Action Research} and \textit{Design Science Research}.

This is because the paper will be based on a 
dataset which will be analyzed to help a 
potential company to make better decisions, or 
to find ways to improve their business.

It could also be used to find new ways to visualize
data in a more efficient way.

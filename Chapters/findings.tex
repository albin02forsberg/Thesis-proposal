\section{Expected Findings}
The software used in [1] was Hadoop, which is an open source framework that uses an HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to store large amounts of data. To process and analyze data, a programming module called MapReduce is used.  As mentioned earlier in the text, the project will not use Hadoop, but the findings were made through it. (Not done yet!)

\section{Methology}

This paper will mainly use experiments and surveys to collect data. 
The experiments will be both qualitative and quantitative and 

The paper will be based on a dataset which will be visualized and analyzed
using different methods. What the dataset will be about is not yet decided yet 
because we are awaiting answers from possible companies that could 
be interested in the system we are developing. 

The experiments will be conducted on the given dataset and the results
will be analyzed and compared to the results from the surveys.

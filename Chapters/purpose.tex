\section{Purpose}
The main purpose of this project is to combine our knowledge of programming to provide visualization of large data through charts to help improve different types of businesses. According to~\cite{pyvis}, humans have it easier to understand and analyze data if it is presented in different graphs, colors, and sizes rather than plain text with simple words and numbers. Therefore, one of the research questions that we want to investigate is how effective the human brain is in understanding and analyzing data when the data is presented through charts with different sizes and colors. 

As mentioned earlier in the text, the project has two different paths depending on the amount of time provided. If the time given is enough to create algorithms that will predict and visualize data, then two questions come to mind: the effectiveness of the predictions and the impact of them. The other option is to create a website containing different types of data visualization to see the impact of it and if the business can improve with the provided statistics.

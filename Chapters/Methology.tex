\section{Methology}

The paper will use different methods, such as combining experiments, surveys, and a literature study to address the goals specified in the theoretical framework. The study will use quantitative experiments: statistical analysis and surveys.

Surveys will be used to gather the nurses perspective and opinion regarding the visualizations and analyses from the provided data sets. With the answers provided by the survey takers, the authors can get an understanding of how well and understandable the visualization and analyses were presented. Statistical analysis will be used to analyze the data set through different types of charts on our own built free-to-use website. A thorough literature study will be used to explore other existing studies like the context being investigated in this paper, when it comes to data visualization and big data analytics.

The combination of the methods described above will be used together with the data set provided by the hospital to contribute to the field of data visualization and big data analytics.

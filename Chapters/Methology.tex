\section{Methology}

This paper will mainly use experiments and surveys to collect data. 
The experiments will be both qualitative and quantitative.

The paper will be based on a dataset which will be visualized and analyzed
using different methods. What the dataset will be about is not yet decided 
because we are awaiting answers from possible companies that could 
be interested in the system we are developing.

The experiments will use the given dataset to analyze and visualize the
data in the most optimal and efficient way. The surveys will use 
the given analyzed data and visualization to compare the results with 
what the survey participants thing about the data and visualization.

The paper will also use a literature study to find out what previous 
research has been done in the area of data visualization, big data analytics.
